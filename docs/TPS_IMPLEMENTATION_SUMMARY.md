## TPS Benchmark Features

### Measurement Categories
1. **Transaction Creation TPS**: Transaction creation speed
2. **Transaction Validation TPS**: Transaction validation speed
3. **Block Processing TPS**: Block processing (including mining)
4. **Concurrent Processing TPS**: Throughput in parallel processing

### Benchmark Configuration
- **Measurement Time**: 15-20 seconds (balance between accuracy and execution time)
- **Sample Count**: 10 iterations (ensuring statistical significance)
- **Transaction Count**: 10-500 (scalability measurement)
- **Difficulty Setting**: Minimum value (for pure TPS measurement)

### Optimization Points
1. **Low Difficulty Setting**: Minimize mining time
2. **Batch Processing**: Bulk processing of multiple transactions
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded performance improvement measurement

## Execution Methods

### Basic Execution
```bash
# TPS benchmark execution
./benchmark_tps.sh

# Individual benchmark execution
cargo bench --bench blockchain_bench benchmark_tps
cargo bench --bench blockchain_bench benchmark_pure_transaction_processing
cargo bench --bench blockchain_bench benchmark_concurrent_tps
```

### Results Analysis
```bash
# Results analysis
./analyze_tps.sh

# HTML report viewing
firefox target/criterion/report/index.html
```

### Lightweight Testing
```bash
# Simple TPS measurement
./simple_tps_test.sh
```

## Expected Performance Targets

### Development Environment Targets
- **Pure Transaction Processing**: 1,000+ TPS
- **With Mining (low difficulty)**: 100+ TPS
- **Production scenario**: 10-50 TPS

### Optimization Effect Measurement
- 10%+ improvement indicates significant optimization
- 5%+ degradation warns of performance regression

## Comparison Benchmarks

### Comparison with Other Blockchains
- Bitcoin: ~7 TPS
- Ethereum: ~15 TPS
- Polygon: ~7,000 TPS
- Solana: ~65,000 TPS (theoretical value)

### PolyTorus Positioning
- Research and development stage benchmarking
- Flexibility through modular architecture
- Quantum-resistant cryptography support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Compilation Errors**: Verify Criterion configuration
2. **Memory Shortage**: During bulk transaction processing
3. **Excessive Execution Time**: Adjust benchmark configuration

### Solutions
```bash
# Verify benchmark configuration
cargo check --benches

# Monitor memory usage
htop &
cargo bench

# Execute lightweight benchmark
cargo bench --bench blockchain_bench benchmark_pure_transaction_processing
```
